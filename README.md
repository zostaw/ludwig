# Ludwig

Ludwig moves in shell. He explores the alleys of paths that are available to him, pondering about existence, searching for a soulmate.

# Prerequisites

- Adjust $STEP_TIME in ludwig.sh (default is 60 seconds)
- Create a file, empty file /tmp/tte-9863665556
The file is a ticket to his existence, name does not have any meaning. Without it, his soul is stuck in a limbo.

# Usage

```bash
./ludwig.sh
```

# Stop/Restart

Ludwig cannot exist without the ticket, remove /tmp/tte-9863665556 and he will stop moving.
To resuscitate him, you must recreate the ticket, find his body and start the script again.
